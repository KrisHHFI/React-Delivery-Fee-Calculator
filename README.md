## About

The calculator is a React component, which is called via the main App. I created the calculator in around 100 lines of code. I tried to keep the code simple and self explanatory. If the user resizes the window, the calculator resizes respectively. If your browser does not run the program, go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
